            <h1>Danielle Wu</h1>
        <p>I’m a former human resources professional turned UX/UI student. Although HR gave me the satisfaction of helping others, I always felt a calling to do something more creative. Over the years, I volunteered to design announcements for events and company newsletters. The joy I experienced from creating something that was both useful and visually pleasing made me realize I needed to incorporate design and creativity into my work. Enter UX/UI design! This field would allow me to utilize my HR background to solve design problems in an empathetic, yet process-driven way. 
        </p>
        <h1>Fun Facts</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>I love snowboarding! You can find me on the mountain anytime there’s a snow storm.</li>
            <li>I enjoy hiking but only to places with a rewarding view.</li>
            <li>I sold my first piece of art in a gallery when I was 15. It was a charcoal drawing of a mother and child.</li>
